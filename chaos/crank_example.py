# This demo solves the time-dependent convection-diffusion equation by
# a SUPG stabilized method. The velocity field used
# in the simulation is the output from the Stokes (Taylor-Hood) demo.
# The sub domains for the different boundary conditions are computed
# by the demo program in src/demo/subdomains.
#
# FIXME: Add shock capturing term and then revert back to the Stokes
#        velocity
# FIXME: This demo showcase experimental features of a RKSolver (time integrator)
# FIXME: using a MultiStageScheme. It could be removed or changed anytime.

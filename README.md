THIS IS A REPO FOR STORING THE CODE USED TO GENERATE AND ANALYZE THE DATA IN THE MBDOE PAPER (DOI TO BE INCLUDED). THIS WILL ALSO BE FROZEN IN ZENODO FOR FUTURE USE.

TAPsolver is an open-source, python program for the analysis of Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) reactor experiments. The methods of analysis available (as well as the ones we're working on and the ones we'd love to see) include:

The python packages [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/)  (Finite Element Computational Software) and [Dolfin-Adjoint](http://www.dolfin-adjoint.org/en/latest/) act as the foundation of TAPsolver and allow for the flexible and efficient application of [algorithmic differentiation](https://towardsdatascience.com/automatic-differentiation-explained-b4ba8e60c2ad). TAPsolver was also closely developed alongside [TAPSAP](https://github.com/IdahoLabResearch/tapsap), which is used for processing and statistically analyzing raw TAP experimental data.

### Collaborators and Funding

TAPsolver was developed through a colloboration between the Georgia Institute of Technology and Idaho National Lab. The publication associated with TAPsolver can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13584). 

Financial support for the development of TAPsolver was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy (USDOE), Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Advanced Manufacturing Office Next Generation R\&D Projects under contract no. DE-AC07-05ID14517.

# TAPsolver
TAPsolver is an open-source, python based Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) simulation and analysis tool. The python packages [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/)  (Finite Element Computational Software) and [Dolfin-Adjoint](http://www.dolfin-adjoint.org/en/latest/) act as the foundation of TAPsolver and allow for the flexible and efficient application of [automatic differentiation](https://towardsdatascience.com/automatic-differentiation-explained-b4ba8e60c2ad). 

**Simulation options include**:

* *State-defining*
* *State-altering*
* *Multi-site* 
* *Pump-probe* 

**Processing options include**:

* *Sensitivity analysis*
* *Parameter optimization*
* *Moment analysis*
* *Y-procedure / G-procedure*

By generalizing TAP simulation and analysis options and providing roboust documentation, TAPsolver should offer the TAP community a centralized location for method development and application, as well as a consistent tool for processing experimental data.

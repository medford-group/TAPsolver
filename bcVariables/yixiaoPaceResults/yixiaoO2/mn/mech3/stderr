|       A note about this anaconda and modules: This version of           |
|       Anaconda doesn’t play well with modules - once you load the       |
|       this module treat this module as the the VERY last one to load.   |
|       We cannot undo changes that conda introduces, so start in a new   |
|       shell if you need to switch or re-load modules                    |
|                                                                         |

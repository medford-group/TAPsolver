

# 1. Construct Experimental TAP object (Exact solution)

# 2. Store Experimental TAP object

# 3. Construct Fitting TAP object
#      - Select initial guess

# 4. Store Fitting TAP object

# 5. Run Experiment at initial set of conditions 
#      - Store data in experiment_1_folder

# 6. Fit parameters 
#      - Store fitted parameters 

# 7. Quantify uncertainty

# 8. Make new TAP object based on results
#      - Automated parameter update in TAP object

# 9. Define sample distribution of initial conditions
#      - Copy input script and exection file to each folder

# 10. Submit each calculation 
#      - Delete the large scripts after running
#      - Store individual estimations

# 11. Generate matrix of objective values
#      - Store single value

# 12. Run Experiment at new set of conditions 
#      - Store as "-A"
#      - Merge with other data set

# 13. Construct multi-experiment objective
#      - Mixture of "-A" and "", etc.

# 14. Fit parameters 
#      - Store fitted parameters 

# 15. Quantify uncertainty

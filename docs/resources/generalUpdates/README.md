# General Updates 

## May 7th, 2022 

The documentation for TAPsolver is actively being revamped, with an emphasis on Jupyter notebooks. A small (but not insignificant) number of potential users have reached out about basic questions of implementing TAPsolver into their own problems. Hopefully proper and robust documentation (like that of TAPSAP) will help allieviate these questions and make TAPsolver more inviting to new users.

It is also important to note that the documentation only applies to the new version of TAPsolver, where the older version will soon be phased out.

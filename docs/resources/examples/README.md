# Examples

Two examples are presented: one for carbon monoxide adsorption and carbon monoxide oxidation. These give the user an appropriate understanding of TAPsolvers functions and how to properly implement them. It should be easy for the user to implement their own, more complex simulations after following these two examples.

Some details are glossed over, but can be found [here](https://github.com/medford-group/TAPsolver/tree/master/docs/resources/input_file).
